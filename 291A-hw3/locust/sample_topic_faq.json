        "Weightlifting as a Vegetarian":{
            "Can vegetarians build muscle as effectively as meat-eaters?": "Yes, muscle growth depends on progressive resistance training and sufficient protein intake. If you stick to a diet with enough protein and balance and a progressive overload training plan, vegetarians can also gain strength/build muscle as effectively as meat-eaters.",
            "What are good protein sources for vegetarians?": "Legumes, tofu, tempeh, seitan, quinoa, eggs, greek yogurt, cottage cheese, nutritional yeast, gluten flour, and more.",
            "How much protein do I really need?": "Aim for 0.7-1.0 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day. For a 150lb lifter, that would be 105-150g of protein spread throughout the day.",
            "What is a complete protein?": "A food is a complete protein when it contains all nine of the essential amino acids necessary in human diet. This includes eggs, dairy, soy products, quinoa, buckwheat, and hemp. Some common vegetarian incomplete protein sources include nuts and seeds, whole grains, vegetables, and legumes. However, as long as you eat a variety of complete + incomplete proteins, your body will be able to form complete proteins. For example, beans and grains can be paired to make a complete protein.",
            "Do I need to use protein powder as a vegetarian?": "It is not strictly necessary to use protein powder on your weightlifting journey as a vegetarian as long as you prioritize protein in your diet. Otherwise, it is perfectly good to help boost your protein intake with protein powder, especially on days when you have less time to cook protein heavy meals.",
            "Can I get enough iron on a vegetarian diet?": "Though plant iron is absorbed less efficiently than meat based iron, you can definitely get enough iron on a vegetarian diet through lentils, spinach, beans. Try pairing these foods with vitamin C rich foods like bell peppers or citrus to boost the iron's absorption.",
            "Should I use creatine? Is it vegetarian-friendly?": "Yes! Most creatine powders are synthetic. Creatine improves strength, power/energy, muscle growth, and has even been linked to improved cognitive function. It's been studied to be especially helpful in vegetarian diets, as vegetarians do not get creatine from their diet naturally, unlike meat-eaters.",
            "Do soy products affect hormone levels?": "There are some beliefs that eating soy products affects hormones, but a moderate intake of soy is safe and studies do show that soy protein does not reduce testosterone or worsen strength gains.",
            "What are some good high-calorie vegetarian foods for bulking?": "Nuts, seeds, avocado, olive oil, whole grains, and full-fat dairy like yogurt and cheese are great high-calorie foods for bulking!",
            "What's the biggest tip for vegetarian lifters?": "Tracking nutrition at first to make sure you're eating enough protein and calories to grow stronger is really helpful. It can be harder for vegetarians to get enough protein on a daily basis compared to meat-eaters, so it helps a lot, especially in the beginning, to track your protein intake."

            "What is my fictional dream car?": "There is a car called Beck Kustoms F132 in a video game called \"Need for Speed\", and its combination of futuristic F1 car and hot rod is just perfect. Someone made a real-life version of it, but it just feels different from in-game.",
            "What is my non-fictional unrealistic dream car?": "As of now, I believe Rauh-Welt Begriff (RWB) Porsche 911 with the widebody kit is on the top. It is unrealistic not just because of it's cost, but because of its rarity: it is basically hand-built by one person!",

        "Japan in my eyes":{
            "What is Japan for me?": "Japan is a magical place that holds a special significance for me. As a Japanese person who lived in China, I used to visit Japan every summer during my break. These trips allowed me to experience the beautiful and fun aspects of the country. Additionally, I once traveled to Japan alone for a month, which was a transformative experience that helped me find myself.",
            "What are some myths about Japan?": "Japanese people are nice, but also very reserved. Usually if you don't strike up a conversation yourself, they will be either indifferent or polite.",
            "Why is Japan my most recommended solo-travel destination?": "Japan is very safe, clean, and has literally endless places to explore. On their way, people will also feel the right amount of loneliness from the remote environment, which is, in my opinion, a perfect place for them to know more about themselves rather than others.",
            "What is my recommended hidden gem stone in Japan?": "There are tons of hidden and remote places that travelers will remember for the rest of their lives, but the one for me is Rokko mountain in Kobe, Hyogo prefecture. When I solo traveled there, there was only one hostel there, no public transportation except a gondola lift that carries people on and off the mountain. It is developed enough for you to be able to walk on paved roads, but still feels remote and untouched.",
            "What is my recommendation for anybody who wants to go to Japan?": "With the current state of tourism in Japan, I would suggest planning a trip to a not-so-popular prefecture would be the best option. Personally, I prefer to explore the lesser-known areas, as they often offer a more authentic experience of Japanese culture and lifestyle.",
            "What is the best season to go to Japan?": "Spring, because cherry blossoms are in full bloom around late March to early April, and the temperature is the best around then.",
            "What is my favorite Japanese food?": "Ramen. There are so many different styles and flavors to try, and each region has its own unique take on this beloved dish.",
            "What is my favorite Japanese city?": "Kyoto. It is a city that perfectly blends traditional and modern elements, with its stunning temples, beautiful gardens, and vibrant culture. I would always recommend people to book an Airbnb next to a popular shrine (such as Fushimi Inari Taisha), and visit them at night to avoid the tourism rush.",
            "What is my favorite Japanese tradition?": "Kimodameshi (a test of courage) is a traditional activity in which participants spend a night in a haunted location. It is often done in groups and involves various challenges to confront fears. It definitely feels different when there are so many stories about yurei (ghosts) and yokai (supernatural creatures).",
            "What is my favorite anime?": "Natsume Book of Friends. I watched it as a kid together with my sister, and it perfectly captures the beauty of life, its imperfections, and time."
        },

            "What games am I learning?": "I'm picking up Twilight Struggle, a two-player cold war era wargame (think a more complicated and less dice roll focused version of risk), and Pax Renaissance, a renaissance era game about trade, religion, and prestige",
            "What about Catan, Monopoly, etc.?": "While I enjoy these games, I find modern board games to be more skill expressive and have more intereseting decision spaces",
            "What game should I play to explore more modern board games?": "Of the ones I've played, I would recommend Irish Gauge (a train game) and Race for the Galaxy (an iconic card space-age card game)",
            "Are there games you can play solo?": "Yes, but I prefer to compete with others. Many games have an 'AI' player in the form of a random decision deck.",
            "What do you do if you have too many players at a board game night?": "Some lower stakes games that are more inclusive: liars dice and wizard!",
            "Modern board games are way more expensive than I thought - what should I do?": "Yes, popular modern board games can be anywhere from 40-100 USD. People are collectors though, so buying used is the way to go! I've gotten some of my favorite games for 80-20% off.",
            "What games am I looking to get next?": "I would love terraforming mars and gaia project, but I have enough for now.",
            "It's just me and one other person, what games should I get?": "An easy 2-player designed game I like is 7 Wonders Duel. It's a quick 20 minute card drafting game that has an interesting decision space without being overly complicated. I've played with my parents!",
            "Where can I buy games?": "For new - your best bet is probably Amazon as many of the games come from obscure publishers. Some of the more popular (but still not super mainstream) games will be at Barnes and Noble. For a more comprehensive collection, look for a board game store near you! However, I strongly recommend looking on Facebook marketplace. You can get a good idea of the games to buy from reddit."
